FACS Explained
==============

FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System and is a way to describe a person's facial expression
in terms of muscle contraction and relaxation.
A single muscle group is called an Action Unit (AU) and either has a value between 0-5 or 0-1 (FACSvatar).
It is a system found by Paul Ekman and is often used in affective research.
Since FACS describes facial configurations, it is not only useful for affective analysis,
but also for animation.
