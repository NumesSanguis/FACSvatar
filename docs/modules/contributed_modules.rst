Contributed modules
===================
Currently there are no known modules that add/improve functionality in FACSvatar.

Have you made a FACSvatar-compatible module that could benefit other people?
Please let us know by making an `issue at the GitHub repository <https://github.com/NumesSanguis/FACSvatar/issues>`_ .

See :doc:`../misc/contribute` for how to make your FACSvatar-compatible module.
