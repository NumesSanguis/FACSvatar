Multi-avatars setup
====================

FACSvatar allows for more than 1 data stream at the same time.
You can for example have the AU values of 2 people streamed to 2 avatars in parallel.
Also, you can send the same AU values of 1 person to multiple different avatars.
This page explains in more detail how to do this.
