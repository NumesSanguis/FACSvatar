FACSHuman
=========
`FACSHuman <https://www.michaelgilbert.fr/facshuman/>`_ is an add-on for
`MakeHuman <http://www.makehumancommunity.org/>`_ to generate FACS compatible avatars.

Psychologists might prefer to use FACSHuman over MB-Lab:

- Generated avatars are FACS verified.
- Is like a video editor focusing on facial animation with sliders, not requiring animation experience.
